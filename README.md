# NextJS-Webpage
This is my first attempt at creating a Webpage from scratch using NextJS

## Project
I decided to create a simple [pomodoro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) timer with ambient noise functionality to allow for a softer approach to staying on task.

## Technologies
I used NextJS, TypeScript, very basic CSS, sound effects from [pixabay](https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/), [Howler](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-howler) to handle the sounds being played, and [framer-motion](https://www.npmjs.com/package/framer-motion) for the animation of the timer.
